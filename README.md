## Goal

This was a 3 day solo project. I was asked to build a React application using a API and a pre-planned wireframe for the front-end.

## Overview and Concept

This is a React app with a API, React, NextJS, JavaScript, CSS. Users can view rental homes and for-sale properties, advanced property filtering, property details page with an image carousel, and much more.

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS
- React
- Next
- JavaScript
- API
- Axios
- Npm
- Chakra ui
- React Icons
- Millify
- Framer Motion
- Github
- Google Fonts
- Figma

## Approach Taken:

Day 1 - Firstly I listed all of the API and front-end features that I wished to implement in my app and using Figma I created three rough prototypes and chose my favorite one.
